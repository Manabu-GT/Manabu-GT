# Hi there, I'm Manabu! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Mobile & Web Engineer | Former Project Manager

I am a software engineer based in **Colorado, USA**, currently specializing in Android development.
I love building UI/UX libraries that make developers' lives easier.

### 🔭 Current Focus & Active Open Source Projects

I am currently maintaining and improving:

* 🐛 **[DebugOverlay-Android](https://github.com/Manabu-GT/DebugOverlay-Android)**
  <br>A zero-configuration runtime diagnostics tool fully written in Kotlin + Jetpack Compose. It surfaces real-time performance metrics (CPU, Heap, PSS, FPS) and now includes **Logcat** and **Network** logging panels without requiring dangerous permissions.
